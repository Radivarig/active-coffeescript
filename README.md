# active-coffeescript

Plugin for [draft-js-plugins](https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/draft-js-plugins) that parses coffee-script code from `code-block` text, compiles it to an object and creates entities (like mentions plugin) from property names that will render its value when not in edit mode.

Inspired by [active-markdown](https://github.com/alecperkins/active-markdown)
